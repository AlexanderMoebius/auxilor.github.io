Points are similar to currencies, however they exist purely as a way to keep track of something in a player. For example, lets say you want the player to have to used an item a certain amount of times in order to use another one - you would be able to keep track of this with a point.

You can have as many different points as you want, the plugins will keep track of them automatically. Points are shared between plugins, too - so if you make a point in EcoItems, then you can use it in EcoPets, EcoJobs, etc.

A point can hold any numeric value, including negatives and decimals, but of course how you decide to use them is completely up to you.

There are placeholders for points, or course: they look like `%<plugin>_points_<point>%`, such as `%actions_points_tiredness%`
