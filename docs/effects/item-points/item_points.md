Item Points is an extension to libreforge (not in the base plugin), which adds ways to level up items and store
points directly within them rather than in players or the server.

Just like regular points, you can create as many as you want, and they can hold any numeric value.

## Installation

Item Points is available on [Spigot (Coming Soon)](), [Polymart](), or [BuiltByBit (Coming Soon)]()!

Item Points is installed differently to a regular plugin - instead of being added to `/plugins/`, it's added
to `/plugins/libreforge/extensions/`. Once it's installed, its config files are automatically placed into
`/plugins/libreforge/`.

## Placeholders

`%libreforge_item_points_<point>%`
