## What is EcoPets?

Pets are upgradable companions that float around the player, giving them passive (or active) buffs depending on their level. You can craft them, be given them, collect them, whatever you want.

You can make your own pets right in config without any coding knowledge required. Every single aspect of the plugin is completely customisable for you to play with - if you think a pet that does something should exist, you can make it in minutes.

A player can activate a pet by opening the GUI with `/pets`
