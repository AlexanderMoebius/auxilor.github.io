## What are Talismans and why do I want them?
Talismans are items that give players passive buffs while they're in the inventory, ender chest, or shulker box of a player. They can be crafted or given with commands or in crates, and you can make your own levels for any talisman. Use custom textures, crafting recipes, names, descriptions - anything that you want to configure, you can. Make your own talismans with a powerful effect and condition system to make talismans perfect for exactly how your server runs.

## Is there a Talisman Bag?
Yes! There's a talisman bag that lets you set the size per-player, it works exactly how you'd want and expect it to - you don't have to use it, but it's enabled by default.
