## What are Actions?

Actions are mini-scripts that let you add and tweak things on your server. From anything as small as little server automations, like losing coins on death or making netherite hoes autosell crops, to something bigger like entire custom currencies that integrate in other plugins, random server events, or anything you want!

Instead of paying a developer to write a custom plugin to add small things to your server, you can just make them right in actions with no coding knowledge required! Anything you want to add, you can - your creativity is the only limit.
