## What is Actions?

Jobs are methods by which players earn money, experience, items, or anything else you want. You can level them up to increase their rewards, put certain jobs behind paywalls if you want, unlock jobs through gameplay, or anything else!

You can make your own jobs right in config without any coding knowledge required. Every single aspect of the plugin is completely customisable for you to play with - if you think a job that does something should exist, you can make it in minutes.
